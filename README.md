<p style="text-align: justify">This is the compilation my system projects during my studying years in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Camarines Norte State College.
We studied several languages to create systems, web, databases and game. Our Capstone Research and Project is our main project in BSIT. We created a game 
application that uses Unity Engine. The game was entitled "Toss and Learn: An Educational Game Application for Sixth Grade Science Subject".</p>
