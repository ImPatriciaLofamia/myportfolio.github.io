		<h1 id="Undead"> The Undead </h1>
		<p>Undead is a collective name for fictional, mythological, or legendary beings that are  
		deceased and yet behave as if alive. It could also describe a dead body animated by  
	supernatural forces (or some other life force) or by either its own soul or the soul of a  
	malevolent creature (such as a Demon). Undead may be incorporeal, such as ghosts,  
	or corporeal, such as vampires and zombies. Undead are featured in the legends of  
	most cultures and in many works of fantasy and horror fiction.
		</p>

		<p>Bram Stoker considered the term "The Un-Dead" for the original title for his novel  
	Dracula (1897), and its use in the novel is mostly responsible for the modern sense of  
	the word. The word does appear in English before Stoker but with the more literal  
	sense of "alive" or "not dead", for which citations can be found in the Oxford English  
	Dictionary. Stoker's use of the term refers only to vampires, and the extension to other  
	types of supernatural beings arose later. Most commonly, it is now taken to refer to  
	supernatural beings which had at one time been alive and continue to display some  
	aspects of life after death, but the usage is highly variable.

		<h1 id= "Dragons"> Dragons </h1>
		<p>Dragons are usually shown in modern times with a body like a huge lizard, or a snake  
	with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and able to emit fire from their mouths. The  
	European dragon has bat-type wings growing from its back. A dragon-like creature  
	with no front legs is known as a wyvern. Following discovery of how pterosaurs  
	walked on the ground, some dragons have been portrayed without front legs and using  
	the wings as front legs pterosaur-fashion when on the ground.</p>

		<p>Although dragons occur in many legends around the world, different cultures have  
	varying stories about monsters that have been grouped together under the dragon  
	label. Some dragons are said to breathe fire or to be poisonous, such as in the Old  
	English poem Beowulf. They are commonly portrayed as serpentine or reptilian,  
	hatching from eggs and possessing typically scaly or feathered bodies. They are  
	sometimes portrayed as having especially large eyes or watching treasure very  
	diligently, a feature that is the origin of the word dragon (Greek drakeï¿½n meaning "to  
	see clearly"). Some myths portray them with a row of dorsal spines. European dragons  
	are more often winged, while Chinese dragons resemble large snakes. Dragons can  
	have a variable number of legs: none, two, four, or more when it comes to early  
	European literature.
